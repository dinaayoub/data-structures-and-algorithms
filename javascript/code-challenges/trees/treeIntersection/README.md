# Challenge Summary

Code challenge for class 32: Tree Intersection

Solution by Dina Ayoub

## Challenge Description

* Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.
* Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Stretch Goals

* Presume you are working with BSTs. How can you improve the performance of your algorithm?
